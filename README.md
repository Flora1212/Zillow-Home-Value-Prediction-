# Zillow-Home-Value-Prediction

The goal of the project is to predict the log-error between Zillow's Zestimate and the actual sale price, given all the features of a home.

●	Fit multiple linear regression models with regularization to control for multicollinearity, and tree-based models (bagging, random forest, boosting) to predict the log-error between Zillow’s estimate of home values and actual sale prices
●	Visualized raw data and predicted outputs using ggplot2, tabplot, corrplot, lattice, leaflet libraries
